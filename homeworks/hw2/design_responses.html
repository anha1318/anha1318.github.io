							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Padding or white space helps users see with clarity and balance when looking at a website or a mobile app. Padding is an important tool to highlight focus areas while improving visual organization, grouping objects together or separating them. It is a misconception that white space is wasted space, however, white space can bring emphasis such as bringing a call to action task during a checkout flow. </p>
