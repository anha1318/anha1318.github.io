					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Website I chose: Krave Beauty

								<img src="assets/imgs/website_original.jpg" />
							
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p>
								 <img src="assets/imgs/website redesigned.jpg" />
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website to provide free resources for vistors. It covers the brand mission and values, how to create a skincare routine, why sunscreen is important, and to educate people on sustainability within beauty products. It is intended for Krave's customers and skincare lovers.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I addressed the one column gap that it had on the left side by moving the search bar to the very top to not have too much negative space. I also changed the search to I want to learn about, to help customers understand more about the goal of this page, which is to learn from the free resources. I also grouped the four main concepts into four quarters to prevent too much scrolling. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
