            Hi! I'm An (she/her/hers). I am a transfer student from SoCal. My hometown is located in the San Gabriel Valley, where it's in between LA, OC, and Riverside. I love the Starbucks Brown Sugar Shaken Espresso with Oat Milk. I like eating soft serve cream, Baekjeong KBBQ, and spam musubi. I'm a self-proclaimed foodie (with no money), and my favorite fruit tea spot in Berkeley so far is Purple Kow!

        <p>My three favorite places to eat in Berkeley:</p>

            <li>Seoul Hot Dog</li>
            <li>Panda Express</li>
        </ul>

                I learned that most designers decide on four factors to help users effectively use a product. They have to think about hierarchy and content to focus on what is the most important information to highlight first. They also have to think about intentions and audience to ensure that a specific target audience will be able to get their problems resolved by this design.

                My favorite part of this article was breaking down the Airbnb app. I thought it was interesting and useful to include “Try London” instead of “Search here.” The recommendation is helpful and it encourages users to be excited to use the app, that is great use of design and marketing.
