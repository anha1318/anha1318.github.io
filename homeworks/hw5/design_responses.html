                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that you can be extremely creative with UI elements. From creating interactive visuals like finding show sizes in the Nike app, you can also swipe a little bit to hide that panel to create more of a wow effect. Overall, I see a lot of principles of design being used throughout these examples like lines, symmetry, color, and emphasis. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is that there are no description needed to explain each example. They are all clearly being communicated, which shows great storytelling. I also like how the article shows both websites and apps so that we can see the diverse list of creative UI that were developed by other artists. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite is the Add to Cart Interaction. It is because I like the select size UI and select color UI to see the shoes being changed to the desired style. The interfaces achieved their goal in a unique manner because the user can drag the panel out and see the ripple/jelly like effect. To me that is very eyecatching and fun to look at, combined with the ability to swipe up and down for sizing.  </p>
