						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Timing is very important to different type of animation. For example, when displaying a list of items such as news cards or email lists, it should have a very short delay between its appearance. If the delay lasts more than 25 ms, the slowness of the animation can annoy the user. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the visual examples. It is hard to read and understand numbers like distances via text. So having visuals to showcase how a slow delay is annoying or how the use of motion blur is not sharp enough on mobile devices, it helped me understand the problems and solutions being represented at hand.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another.							</p>
						</li>
