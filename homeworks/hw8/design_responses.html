					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about the eleven forms that dark patterns appear in. Whether it be on a user interface or a physical product, dark patterns can trick a customer to do things through exploitation. A good example would be hidden costs with e-retailers where the firt package is a free trial but users will be charged a monthly subscription later in the shopping cart. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part is learning about how dark patterns played a role in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Platforms like Facebook, BuzzFeed News used it to personalize what users see based on their observed opinion. This led to confirmation bias, narrowed self-curated perspective, and illegitimacy to facts and information on about the candidates and the election in general. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
